* Since if we keep both the feature extraction algorithms in the same matlab file it is taking a very large amount of time
I have made two folders seperately

* For LBP feature extraction, since it is very time taking i took some less training data compared to 
HOG feature extraction

* I have uploaded the respective train.m files where respective model training along with the feature 
extraction takes place

* Respective test.m files are for the testing part corresponding to the respective feature extraction

* I have also provided the test data and the train data that I have used
